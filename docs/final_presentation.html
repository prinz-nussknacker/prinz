# Introduction

---

## Basic terms

- Event Stream Processing
  - definition of ESP

  - most common use cases

- Fraud detection
  - example categories of fraud

  - usage of Machine Learning and Event Stream Processing

---

## Introduction to Nussknacker and Prinz

- Nussknacker
  - Event Stream Processing tool

  - open-source, developed by TouK

  - easy to use GUI, intended for non-programmers

  - main use case - fraud detection

- Prinz
  - library of extensions for Nussknacker

  - provides integrations with Machine Learning engines/repositories

  - applications are highly configurable thanks to the Prinz API

# Prinz API

---

## Overview

- main goal of the API - consistent and simple integration process

- mandatory traits
  - ModelSignature with SignatureProvider

  - Model and ModelInstance

  - ModelRepository

---

## ModelSignature with SignatureProvider

- ModelSignature
  - defines the input and output format of the model

  - two lists - one for the input and one for the output

  - each entry consists of a SignatureName and SignatureType

- SignatureProvider
  - extracts the signature from a model

  - takes care of the typing

---

## Model, ModelInstance, and ModelRepository

- Model
  - a top-level representation of the model

  - can be instantiated and prepared for scoring

  - gives access to the model metadata

- ModelInstance
  - runnable instance of the model

  - verifies input data and and returns model output

- ModelRepository
  - contains configuration information

  - lists models for a given integration

# MLflow integration

---

## Integration overview

<img id="mlflow-logo" src="./images/mlflow-logo.svg" alt="MLflow logo" title="MLflow logo" />

- project to manage the complete ML models lifecycle

- open-source and open-interface approach to project

- well documented library API

- ML models management (with user friendly Web UI)

- ML models serving

---

## Models lifecycle in prepared environment

1. Configure and set up the MLflow models registry with DB and extra services

2. Train small, toy models and add them to the models registry

3. Serve trained models as service

4. Score trained models from Prinz in Nussknacker

## Extra assumptions

- models trained with signature saved to storage service (S3 bucket)

- served models location depends on the name and version of the model

- models outputs indexing

---

## Models Repository

- based on open source scala HTTP client (`sttp`)

- implementation of MLflow REST API from scratch

- heavy use of Scala `circe` library with `@JsonCodec` approach

- parametrized with external configuration

<img id="mlflow-repository" src="./images/mlflow-run-list.png" alt="MLflow repository" />

---

## Model and Model' Instance

- listed from JSON response from MLflow registry

- models' signatures downloaded from external service

- models converted to instances capable of scoring external service

- need of i/o data conversion

.left-half[

```
my_model/
```
```
- MLmodel
- model.pkl
```

]

.right-half[

```
MLmodel:
```

```yaml
time_created: 2020-12-20T17:28:53.35

flavors:
 sklearn:
 sklearn_version: 0.19.1
 pickled_model: model.pkl
 python_function:
 loader_module: mlflow.sklearn
```

]

---

## Model Signature

- created during training by Data Scientists

- available on external storage service as YAML file

- downloaded once per model loading process

- automatic parse process with strict typing approach

```yaml
signature:
 inputs: >
 [
 {"name": "age", "type": "string"},
 {"name": "gender", "type": "string"},
 {"name": "category", "type": "string"},
 {"name": "amount", "type": "double"}
 ]
 outputs: >
 [
 {"type": "integer"}
 ]
```
